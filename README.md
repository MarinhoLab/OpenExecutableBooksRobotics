## Advanced Lessons

Eight lessons representing the Python version of the course below, related to dual-quaternion algebra using [DQ Robotics](https://dqrobotics.github.io).

```
Kinematic modeling and control of serial-link robotic manipulators using DQ Robotics: From zero to hero.
```

|Number|Title|Content|
|---|---|---|
|1|*Python Basics*|The very basics of Python and `numpy`, including simple mathematical operations.|
|2|*Quaternion Basics*|Representing and manipulating quaternions using DQ Robotics Python. Unit quaternions are also introduced and used to represent the rotation of rigid bodies|
|3|*Dual Quaternion Basics (Part 1)*| Representing and manipulating dual quaternions using DQ Robotics Python. Unit dual quaternions are introduced and used to represent the pose transformation of rigid bodies.|
|4|*Dual Quaternion Basics (Part 2)*| Unit dual quaternions are used to represent lines and planes. Distance functions between points, lines, and planes are also introduced|
|5|*Robot Control Basics (Part 1)*| The basics of the kinematic control of serial-link robotic manipulators. Forward kinematics model, inverse kinematics model, task-space velocity and position control using a 1-DoF planar robot.|
|6|*Robot Control Basics (Part 2)*| Modeling serial robots using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters; the forward kinematics model using the DH parameters; the pose, rotation, translation Jacobians; translation, rotation, and pose task-space controlers; all using a 3-DoF planar robot.|
|7|*Robot Control Basics (Part 3)*| Understanding and handling task-space singularities with a 7-DoF planar robot.|
|8|*Optimization-based Robot Control*| Revisiting the topic of kinematic control using mathematical optimization formulation, implement joint-space and task-space constraints using quadratic programming.|
