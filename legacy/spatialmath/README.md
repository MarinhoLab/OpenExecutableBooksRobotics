In `23-24` and `24-25` iterations of this content, I used `spatialmath` as a tool to mimise coding needs for unrelated parts. However, to simplify experience and rely less on external tools `spatialmath` will be completely phased out in `25-26` and after.

To keep some of this knowledge alive, the removed content will be added to this folder.
